Imagine Dragons - I Wish

I never called you and now it's too late
To say all the words that I've wanted to say
The doctor said, "Oh, there's a fight up ahead"
I should've been there by your hospital bed
So it rains every day, oh, it rains every day
Oh, I haven't got the words to say

How I wish I was a better friend
Before it was too late
I wish that I would've been there in the end
I wish I was a better friend

I wasn't there when you said your goodbye, and I
Replay in my mind 'bout a thousand times
I wasn't therе for those rivers you cried
I was always too busy, no, I didn't makе the time
So it rains every day, oh, it rains every day
Oh, I haven't got the words to say
